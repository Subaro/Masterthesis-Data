# Masterthesis-Data

Contains the data for our masterthesis. The data is separated into two categories. The first category contains individual models that are used to compare the different algorithms for most of the evaluation criteria. The second category contains histories of each one systems that are used for the evaluation of sampling stability. All models are compressed into `.zip` files
